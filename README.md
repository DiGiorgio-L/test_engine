# Welcome to test_engine

This is basically a repository to develop some experience working in "real" coding projects :)

My purpose with this is to build, from (mostly) scratch, a simple game/rendering engine that supports 3D. This idea was born from the adquisition of a book about computer graphics.

I will update this readme with my progress and maybe the planned roadmap (I don't have a roadmap yet...)
